This means you can install GPU accelerated versions of machine libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. \n",

    "To do this, you need to manually install various CUDA libraries. For full details on how to install these see https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu (both for Windows and Linux). Once you've done that you can edit the scripts below where indicated, so the GPU enabled Python versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow are installed (rather than the CPU version). Note, the CPU versions work fine, but will be slower and by default the environments below install CPU versions for maximum compatibility in case you don't have an NVIDIA card. If you are running on the cloud, you need to check that the cloud machine you are using has a GPU. Typically free instances are CPU only."
